Lab 7 challenge 1: Created a diagongle line of ellipses that went across the canvas. These ellipses were created by using a loop. The shapes then 
also all had random colors because of the use of an array which made it so everytime the code was played each circle had a random color, this was also used by adding the call random to the array.

Lab 7 challenge 2: For challenge 2 I used a nested loop which added both columns and rows to create a grid of circles. Then I added a gradient by putting numbers into fill and assigning the red channel of the color to go up by 10.

Lab 7 challenge 3: For challenge 3 I duplicated the previous code and made it interactive by adding a mouseIsPressed function. I created another function 
and called that in mouseIsPressed on when the I press the mouse my grid of circles turns into 2 stars.
